            <h2>History</h2>
 
            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>Riel was born in Saint-Boniface, in the Red River settlement (now Winnipeg).
                His father was a businessman and a political leader in the Métis community.
                His involvement likely influenced Louis who left Red River at a young age
                to study in Quebec.</p>
            <p>Riel was an exemplary scholar during his formal education as well as during
                his years at the Sulpician school in Montreal. However, after an engagement
                with a young French-Canadian woman was broken off, he left the seminary and
                moved back to Red River.</p>
           
            <h3>Red River Resistance</h3>
            <p>After moving back to Red River, Riel rose to prominence during the Red River
                Resistance of 1869-1870, where he led efforts to protect Métis rights as
                Canada expanded westward. His government negotiated Manitoba's entry into
                Confederation, but his orders to execute Orangeman Thomas Scott made him
                an unfriendly figure in Protestant Ontario.</p>
 
            <h3>Exile, Return, and Capture</h3>
            <p>When Ottawa sent troops Manitoba, Riel sensed that the troops were out to
                lynch him. He fled to the US to avoid prosecution. During this, he was
                elected into Parliament multiple times but never once took his seat. He
                also was institutionalized as he experienced multiple religious visions.
                In 1884, he returned to Canada to lead the North-West Resistance, but was
                defeated, captured, and tried for treason.</p>
           
            <h3>Death</h3>
            <p>Riel was executed in 1885. His death polarized Canada as English-speaking
                Canadians largely viewed him as a traitor, while French-Canadians and Métis
                view him as a martyr.</p>
